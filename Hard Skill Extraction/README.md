# Hard Skill Extraction

## Problem Statement:
Amanda wants to build a team of highly skilled 
software engineers. For this, she wants to find teammates who meet all 
the technical skills as per the job requirement. While researching, she found a raw dataset of **over 30k datapoints** 
(Raw_Skills_Dataset.csv) which contain technical skills and a lot of jargon 
mixed in. 
The task is to **develop a code** that can **clean this dataset** and **extract 
Technical (Hard) skills**.
